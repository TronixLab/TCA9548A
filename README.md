# TCA9548A
I2C Multiplexer sketch for Arduino and other supported boards. This is a simple solution for multiple I2C sensors with identical addresses, and support from 8 up to 64 I2C modules. This repo uses the following sensors:
* SHT21 - temperature and humidity sensor
* TSL2561 - light intensity sensor
* MPU6050 - IMU sensor
